Single Node Foundation
----------------------

Overview
++++++++

.. note::

  Estimated time to complete: **90 Minutes**

Foundation is used to automate the installation of the hypervisor and Controller VM on one or more nodes. In this exercise you will deploy a Foundation VM on a single Nutanix node (Node D) and use it to image one of other nodes (A, B or C). All students will create a Foundation VM however, you must decide between you which node you will be rebuilding. (As there are only 3 nodes you will need to work in pairs). The end result is that nodes A, B and C will be re-imaged ready for the next exercise of creating and configuring a Nutanix Cluster.

Cabling Your Hardware
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

  The following lab will be performed with a cluster in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. The information on cabling below is for reference when performing a physical, bare metal Nutanix installation.

Foundation requires connectivity to **both** the standard network interface of a node and the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) network interface. The BMC, called **IPMI** on Nutanix NX nodes, is a dedicated system present in every enterprise server platform used for out of band management. Other supported platforms use different names for IPMI, such as iDRAC on Dell, IMM on Lenovo, and iLO on HPE.

Referring to the example diagram below, there are two options for cabling Nutanix nodes prior to imaging with Foundation:

- Using two cables per node, one connected to either onboard LAN port and one connected to the dedicated IPMI port.
- Using one cable per node, connected to the **Shared IPMI** port. With only the **Shared** port connected, it is capable of intelligently forwarding traffic to either the IPMI or LAN interface, allowing Foundation to communicate with both interfaces simultaneously.

.. figure:: images/back-panel.png

.. note::

  During node power off/on the Shared port on certain platforms may switch between 100Mb and 1Gb speeds, which can cause issues if your switch cannot auto-negotiate to the proper speed.

  Additionally, for nodes such as the NX-3175 which only have 10Gb SFP+ onboard NICs, the 1Gb transceiver used to connect to your flat switch requires electrical power. That power is only available when the node is powered on, making it critical to use two cables per node in this situation.

  Overall, if there are sufficient cables and ports available, using two cables per node is preferred.

Both the nodes and the host used to run the Foundation VM should be connected to the same flat switch. If imaging on a customer switch, ensure that any ports used are configured as **Access** or **Untagged**, or that a **Native** VLAN has been configured.

Refer to the appropriate `manufacturer's hardware documentation <https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/docs/list?type=hardware>`_ to determine the locations of the **IPMI** and **Shared** ports.

Installing Foundation
+++++++++++++++++++++

Foundation is distributed as a VM image that can be run on multiple platforms, including AHV, VMware ESXi, VMware Workstation/Fusion, and Oracle VirtualBox. When deploying a local instance of the Foundation VM, refer to the `Field Installation Guide <https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/docs/details?targetId=Field-Installation-Guide-v4-3:Field-Installation-Guide-v4-3>`_ for direction on virtual network configuration. In general, the VM wants to be configured with a **Bridged** network connection and configured with an IP in the same subnet as the planned IP scheme for CVM/hypervisor of the cluster being imaged.

.. note::

  Always use the latest available version of Foundation to image your cluster.

Open \https://10.42.**XYZ-OCTET**.32:9440 in your browser to access the single Nutanix node (Node D) using Prism. Log in with the following credentials:

- **Username** - admin
- **Password** - *nht2EMEA!*


This is a fresh deployment and the node will not have any network configuration. Follow these steps to create a single native VLAN network.

#. In Prism select **VM**, click **Table**, click **Network Config**, this is located at the far right of the screen.

#. Click **+ Create Network**.

- For the **Network Name** type in **AllTraffic**.
- For the **VLAN ID** type in **0**.
- Click **Save**


In Prism select **VM**, click **Table**, click **+ Create VM**.

Using the `Cluster Details`_ spreadsheet, fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

- **Name** - Foundation-*<INITIALS>*
- **vCPU(s)** - 2
- **Number of Cores per vCPU** - 1
- **Memory** - 4 GiB
- Select **+ Add New Disk**

  - **Operation** - Clone from Image Service
  - **Image** - Foundation
  - Select **Add**
- Select **Add New NIC**

  - **VLAN Name** - *Name of the earlier created network*
  - Select **Add**

Select your **Foundation-<INITIALS>** VM and click **Power on**.

Once the VM has started, click **Launch Console**.

Once the VM has finished booting, click **nutanix**. Enter the default password (**nutanix/4u**) and click **Log In**.

.. figure:: images/1.png

Double-click **set_foundation_ip_address > Run in Terminal**.

Select **Device configuration** and press **Return**.

.. figure:: images/2.png

Select **eth0** and press **Return**.

.. figure:: images/3.png

.. note:: Use the arrow keys to navigate between menu items.

Using the `Cluster Details`_ spreadsheet, fill out the following fields, select **OK** and press **Return**:

.. figure:: images/4.png

.. note::

  The Foundation VM IP address should be in the same subnet as the target IP range for the CVM/hypervisor of the nodes being imaged. As Foundation is typically performed on a flat switch and not on a production network, the Foundation IP can generally be any IP in the target subnet that doesn't conflict with the CVM/hypervisor/IPMI IP of a targeted node.

Select **Save** and press **Return**.

.. figure:: images/5.png

Select **Save & Quit** and press **Return**.

Close the Foundation VM console.

Preparing Foundation
++++++++++++++++++++

For Foundation to work it needs to have access to installation files. This should be Hypervisor ISO files (some specific to the hardware vendor like Dell, Fujitsu and Lenovo) and AOS.
As we are going to install AHV as the hypervisor we only need to "upload" the AOS installation files. To get to the files, we need to open the commandline of the Foundation VM and download a file.
Follow these steps to upload the AOS 5.11.1.1 onto the Foundation VM.

#. ssh into the Foundation VM
#. Login in to the VM using **nutanix** as the username and **nutanix/4u** as the password.

  .. figure:: images/20.png

#. cd into ``/home/nutanix/foundation/nos``
#. Run the command ``wget http://10.42.194.11/workshop_staging/nht/nutanix_installer_package-release-euphrates-5.11.2.3-stable-x86_64.tar.gz`` this will pull the AOS image from the Staging server within the HPOC environment

  .. figure:: images/21.png

#. Wait till the wget command has finished. Run ``ls -al`` to see the just "pulled" file.

  .. figure:: images/22.png

.. note:: The upload of the installation files can also be done via the GUI, but due to keep most of the network traffic internal in the HPOC environment, these steps were the easiest and speediest one.



Running Foundation
++++++++++++++++++

Open \http://*<Foundation VM IP>*:8000/gui/index.html in your browser to access Foundation.

.. note::

  **DO NOT** access the Foundation UI from the Foundation VM console. Close your Foundation VM console and access the Foundation UI via a browser in your Citrix desktop.

Review the **Start** page details as it contains several helpful tips for cabling your physical hardware.

.. figure:: images/7b.png


Choose the **network to use** by clicking the selection box for Option 2.

.. figure:: images/7c.png

Choose the **hardware type** for Option 4.

.. figure:: images/7d.png


Type in the subnet mask and default gateway values found in the `Cluster Details`_ spreadsheet for your cluster details.

.. figure:: images/7e.png

Click **Next**.

.. note::

  Foundation will automatically discover any hosts in the same IPv6 Link Local broadcast domain that is not already part of a cluster. When transferring POC assets in the field, it's not uncommon to receive a cluster that wasn't properly destroyed at the conclusion of the previous POC. In this lab, the nodes are already part of existing clusters and will not be discovered.



Click **Click here** to manually specify the MAC address of your assigned node.

.. figure:: images/8b.png

Fill out the following fields and click **Add Nodes**:

- **Number of Blocks** - 1
- **Nodes per Block** - 1
- Select **I will provide the IPMIs' MACs**

.. figure:: images/9b.png

Using the `Cluster Details`_ spreadsheet, fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

.. note::
  Don't use the fourth node (Node D) position! This is your server on which you're running the Foundation VM!

Complete the following fields. The screenshot below shows **examples**, use your `Cluster Details`_ spreadsheet.

- **Node** - *<Node Position>*
- **IPMI MAC** - *<IPMI MAC>*
- **IPMI IP** - *<IPMI IP>*
- **Host IP** - *<Hypervisor IP>*
- **CVM IP** - *<CVM IP>*
- **Hypervisor Hostname** - *<Hypervisor Hostname>*

.. figure:: images/10b.png

.. note::
  In addition to the IPMI MAC address labels on the back of each node. Watchtower can be used to collect the IPMI MAC addresses of any NX appliance: *\http://watchtower.corp.nutanix.com/factoryData/<Block Serial>/*

Click **Next**.

- Select **Skip automatic cluster formation (e.g. you will use the command line)**.
- For **Memory Allocation of Every CVM** - type in 32.
- Click **Next**.

.. figure:: images/11b.png

.. note::

  Refer to **AOS Release Notes > Controller VM Memory Configurations** for guidance on CVM memory allocation based on your specific use case.

.. note::

  In a typical scenario, imaging a cluster with Foundation for a POC, you would want Foundation to automatically create the cluster. The additional fields that are required for Foundation to create the cluster can be referenced in the screenshot below:

  .. figure:: images/12b.png

  In this exercise, each team of two will manually create the cluster after imaging their individual nodes with Foundation. Attempting to automatically create the cluster with a single, standard node will fail.

.. note::

  When imaging a cluster with Foundation, the CVMs and hypervisor management IP addresses must be in the same subnet. IPMI IP addresses can be in the same, or different, subnet. If the IPMI is not in the same subnet as the CVM/hypervisor, Foundation can be configured to use different IP addresses for IPMI and CVM/hypervisor while on a flat, L2 network. Be careful to avoid duplicate IP address when specifying the **IP of the Interface for the Hypervisor-CVM Subnet**.

.. figure:: images/19.png

Foundation will leverage IPMI (or the Out of Band Management standard for the given hardware platform, e.g. iDRAC, iLO, CIMC, etc.) to boot each node to a virtual CD image called Phoenix. The Phoenix image contains what are called "Layout Modules." Layout Modules provide critical hardware information to the installer, allowing Nutanix to support a wide range of hardware configurations (NX, Dell, Lenovo, IBM, Cisco, HPE, Klas, Crystal, etc.).

Phoenix will download the AOS and hypervisor binaries from the Foundation VM. Once Phoenix is booted on each node, Phoenix communicates with Foundation via the node's LAN connection. IPMI is only used for mounting the virtual CD image.

Phoenix will then perform an automated installation of the hypervisor (including any packaged drivers) to the appropriate boot media (SATADOM, SD Card, M.2 SSD) and writes the CVM filesystem to a dedicated partition on the first SSD in the system (NOT on the hypervisor boot media).

After these tasks are completed, the node reboots to the newly installed hypervisor. The hypervisor iterates through the SSDs to find out which SSD has the CVM, and then boots the CVM. Firstboot scripts are run to prepare the hypervisor and CVM on the node, including setting IP information.

.. note::

  In this lab Foundation will not automatically create the cluster due to only a single node being selected. Proceed to the following section to complete cluster creation.
